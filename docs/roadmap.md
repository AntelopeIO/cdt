# Roadmap for CDT

## Summary Milestone 5
Top priority is clean-up of the code and optimizing for support. 
- Remove AntlerProj repos from build and archive AntlerProj
- Vanilla Clang/LLVM
- Upgrade to llvm 16 


## Antler
We lack the reasources to complete the Antler project and support it going forward. Removing dependancies will simplify the build process and simplify things. 

## Vanilla Clang/LLVM
Remove the custom extentions to Clang/LLVM. This will enable us to use Vanilla versions of the packages. This will allow us to use the latest, and will lead to improvements in functionality and performance.

## Upgrade to LLVM 16
Upgrade to the latest
